# Habit Creation and Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds complete habit creation functionality with scheduling and comprehensive filtering capabilities to the Streakly app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Habit Creation (`AddHabitPage`)

- **Complete Form Validation**: All steps properly validate user input
- **Habit Controller Integration**: Uses `HabitController` to actually save habits to storage
- **Automatic Scheduling**: When users enable reminders, notifications are automatically scheduled
- **Success Feedback**: Shows confirmation messages when habits are created successfully
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles and displays any errors during habit creation

### 2. Filtering System (`HabitController`)

Added comprehensive filtering methods to the `HabitState` class:

#### Time-based Filtering:

- `getHabitsByTimeOfDay(TimeOfDayPreference)` - Filter habits by time preference
- `getTodaysHabitsByTimeOfDay(TimeOfDayPreference)` - Get today's habits filtered by time
- `getTodaysHabitsGroupedByTime()` - Group today's habits by all time periods

#### Day-based Filtering:

- `getHabitsByDayOfWeek(int)` - Get habits due on specific weekdays
- `getHabitsForDayAndTime(int, TimeOfDayPreference)` - Combined day and time filtering

#### Special Filtering Logic:

- **Anytime Filter**: When `TimeOfDayPreference.anytime` is selected, it returns ALL habits (morning, afternoon, evening, and anytime habits)
- **Specific Time Filters**: When morning/afternoon/evening is selected, only returns habits specifically set for that time
- **Smart Day Matching**: Correctly handles different frequency types (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)

### 3. Riverpod Providers

Added convenient providers for easy state access:

```dart
// Time-based providers
final habitsForTimeOfDayProvider = Provider.family<List<Habit>, TimeOfDayPreference>
final todaysHabitsByTimeProvider = Provider.family<List<Habit>, TimeOfDayPreference>
final morningHabitsProvider = Provider<List<Habit>>
final afternoonHabitsProvider = Provider<List<Habit>>
final eveningHabitsProvider = Provider<List<Habit>>
final anytimeHabitsProvider = Provider<List<Habit>>

// Day-based providers
final habitsForDayOfWeekProvider = Provider.family<List<Habit>, int>
final habitsForDayAndTimeProvider = Provider.family<List<Habit>, ({int dayOfWeek, TimeOfDayPreference timeOfDay})>

// Grouped providers
final todaysHabitsGroupedProvider = Provider<Map<TimeOfDayPreference, List<Habit>>>
```

### 4. Home Page Integration (`HomePage`)

- **Filter Tabs**: Horizontal scrollable tabs for selecting time preferences (Anytime, Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- **Dynamic Habit List**: Shows habits filtered by the selected time preference
- **Interactive Habit Tiles**: Tap to mark habits complete/incomplete
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Completed habits show checkmarks and different styling
  - Streak indicators with fire icons
  - Smooth animations for interactions
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no habits match the current filter
- **Error Handling**: Shows error states if data loading fails

### 5. Enhanced Main Wrapper

- **Better Success Feedback**: Shows snackbar confirmation when habits are created
- **Automatic Data Refresh**: The habit list automatically updates when new habits are added

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Habit

1. Tap the + button in the main navigation
2. Fill in the habit details (title, type, frequency, etc.)
3. Optionally set time of day preference and reminders
4. Tap "Create Habit" - the habit is automatically saved and scheduled

### Filtering Habits

Use the providers in any widget:

```dart
// Get all morning habits for today
final morningHabits = ref.watch(morningHabitsProvider);

// Get habits for a specific time preference
final eveningHabits = ref.watch(todaysHabitsByTimeProvider(TimeOfDayPreference.evening));

// Get all habits grouped by time
final groupedHabits = ref.watch(todaysHabitsGroupedProvider);

// Get habits for specific day and time
final mondayMorningHabits = ref.watch(habitsForDayAndTimeProvider((
  dayOfWeek: 1, // Monday
  timeOfDay: TimeOfDayPreference.morning
)));
```

### Filter Behavior

- **Anytime**: Shows ALL habits regardless of their time preference
- **Morning**: Shows only habits specifically set for morning
- **Afternoon**: Shows only habits specifically set for afternoon
- **Evening**: Shows only habits specifically set for evening

This allows users to:

- See everything at once (Anytime filter)
- Focus on specific time periods (Morning/Afternoon/Evening filters)
- Plan their day effectively by time blocks

## Technical Details

### Data Flow

1. User creates habit in `AddHabitPage`
2. `HabitController.addHabit()` saves to repository and schedules notifications
3. State updates automatically trigger UI refresh
4. Home page filters are recalculated based on new data
5. User can immediately see and interact with the new habit

### Notification Integration

- Habits with reminders automatically get scheduled using `NotificationService`
- Scheduling respects the frequency settings (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Completion/incompletion automatically manages future notifications

### Error Handling

- Repository errors are caught and displayed to users
- Loading states prevent interactions during data operations
- Validation prevents invalid habit creation

This implementation provides a complete, user-friendly habit management system with powerful filtering capabilities that will scale well as users add more habits to their routine.
