# Streakly Development Progress

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### **Home Page**

- **Dark Mode Improvements**

  - Replaced gradient backgrounds with solid, professional colors.
  - Used neutral dark grays for incomplete and completed habit tiles.
  - Added subtle borders for better definition without being distracting.
  - Improved responsiveness across all screen sizes (iPhone SE to iPhone 13 Pro Max).

- **Modular Components**

  - Divided the home page into reusable components:
    - **HabitFilterTabs**: Time-based filtering tabs (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Anytime).
    - **HabitCard**: Minimal habit display with expandable goal section.
    - **HabitsList**: Handles loading, error, and empty states.
    - **EmptyState**: Reusable empty state widget.
    - **ErrorState**: Reusable error state widget.
    - **StreakIndicator**: Streak display widget with fire icon.

- **Habit Visibility Logic**

  - Fixed edge cases for habit visibility:
    - **Future Dates**: Habits show for upcoming days only if they match the frequency pattern.
    - **Past Dates**: Habits only show if:
      - They were due on that date.
      - They are set to "every day" (daily frequency).
      - The habit existed on that date (created before).
    - **Today**: All applicable habits show regardless of frequency.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Improved layout for small screens (e.g., iPhone SE).
  - Optimized spacing and padding for larger screens (e.g., iPhone 13 Pro Max).
  - Added responsive helpers for dynamic sizing.

### **Habit Controller**

- **Filtering Logic**

  - Added methods to filter habits by time of day and day of the week.
  - Implemented proper date-based filtering for future and past habits.

- **Completion Logic**
  - Added methods to toggle habit completion and handle goal-based habits.
  - Integrated with the expanded goal section in the HabitCard widget.

### **Add Habit Page**

- **Habit Creation**
  - Ensured habits are created with proper scheduling.
  - Fixed edge cases for habit visibility (e.g., future dates only).
  - Integrated with the habit controller for saving and scheduling.

### **Widgets Folder**

- Created reusable components:
  - **HabitFilterTabs**
  - **HabitCard**
  - **HabitsList**
  - **EmptyState**
  - **ErrorState**
  - **StreakIndicator**
