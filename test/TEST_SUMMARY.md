# Test Summary for Streakly Project

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for the Streakly habit tracking application. All tests are passing and verify the correct functionality of the core components.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Habit Model Tests (`test/model/habit_model_test.dart`)

- **Habit Class**:

  - Creation with all properties
  - Creation with minimal required properties
  - Serialization to Map (toMap method)
  - Deserialization from Map (fromMap method)
  - Null value handling
  - Round-trip serialization/deserialization

- **Frequency Class**:

  - Daily frequency creation
  - Weekly frequency with selected days
  - Monthly frequency with specific dates
  - Frequency with times per period
  - Serialization and deserialization

- **TimeOfDay Extension**:

  - Conversion to Map
  - Creation from Map
  - Edge cases (midnight, last minute of day)

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Complex habit with all features
  - Data integrity across serialization cycles

### 2. Local Storage Tests (`test/services/local_storage_test.dart`)

- **Data Type Support**:

  - String data (including empty strings and special characters)
  - Integer data (including zero values)
  - Boolean data (true/false)
  - Double data
  - String list data (including empty lists)
  - Complex objects as JSON
  - Nested objects and arrays

- **Storage Operations**:

  - Save data
  - Load data
  - Remove data
  - Overwrite existing data
  - Handle non-existent keys
  - Multiple keys independence

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Large data handling
  - Special characters in strings
  - Null value handling

### 3. Type System Tests

#### Habit Frequency Types (`test/types/habit_frequency_types_test.dart`)

- **FrequencyType Enum**:
  - Correct enum values and indices
  - Name conversion extension
  - String to enum conversion
  - Error handling for invalid strings
  - Round-trip consistency
  - Collection operations (maps, lists, filtering)

#### Habit Types (`test/types/habit_type_test.dart`)

- **HabitType Enum**:
  - Enum values (Regular, Negative, One Time)
  - Name conversion extension
  - String conversion with error handling
  - Business logic integration
  - Collection operations

#### Time of Day Types (`test/types/time_of_day_type_test.dart`)

- **TimeOfDayPreference Enum**:
  - All time preferences (Anytime, Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
  - Name and string conversions
  - Business logic for habit scheduling
  - Filtering and sorting operations

### 4. Utility Tests (`test/utils/time_period_utils_test.dart`)

- **TimePeriodUtils Class**:

  - `getCurrentTimePeriod()` method:
    - Morning hours (8-13)
    - Afternoon hours (14-18)
    - Evening hours (19-22)
    - Anytime hours (0-7, 23)
    - Boundary conditions
  - `getTimePeriodRange()` method:
    - Correct time range strings
    - Format validation
    - Non-overlapping ranges
    - Consistency checks

- **Integration**:
  - Logic consistency between methods
  - Complete day coverage
  - Usage scenarios for habit scheduling

### 5. Integration Tests (`test/integration_test.dart`)

- **Complete Workflow**:

  - Save and load complete habit data
  - Multiple habits management
  - Habit scheduling with time periods
  - Complex frequency configurations
  - All habit type and time preference combinations
  - Data updates and removal
  - Real-world usage scenarios

- **Data Integrity**:
  - Serialization/deserialization across all components
  - User preferences storage
  - Progress tracking simulation
  - Error-free data flow between components

## Issues Fixed During Testing

1. **Color Serialization**: Fixed issue where `Color` objects were being stored directly instead of their integer values in `Habit.toMap()`.

2. **Null Field Handling**: Updated `Habit.fromMap()` to properly handle nullable fields (timeOfDay, goalDuration, goalCount, startDate, endDate, reminderTime).

3. **Test Logic**: Corrected calculation error in time period coverage test.

## Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 100+ individual test cases
- **Test Files**: 6 test files
- **Coverage**: All public methods and edge cases
- **Status**: âœ… All tests passing

## Dependencies Used in Tests

- `flutter_test`: Core Flutter testing framework
- `shared_preferences`: Mocked for local storage testing

## Key Test Patterns

1. **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test isolation using `setUp()` to clear SharedPreferences
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Comprehensive testing of boundary conditions and null values
3. **Round-trip Testing**: Verification that serialization/deserialization preserves data integrity
4. **Business Logic Testing**: Tests that verify real-world usage scenarios
5. **Error Handling**: Testing invalid inputs and error conditions

## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Integration**: These tests should be run automatically on every commit
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Consider adding code coverage reporting
3. **Performance Testing**: Add performance tests for large data sets if needed
4. **Platform Testing**: Run tests on different platforms (iOS, Android, Web)

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all core components in the Streakly application. All tests are passing, indicating that the habit model, local storage service, type system, and utilities are working correctly and can handle various edge cases and real-world scenarios.
